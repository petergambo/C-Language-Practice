# C-Language-Practice
My practice folder for the C programming language.

## Brief Notes
C is a general purpose programming language. It has been used to write apps such as operating systems (windows etc), python interpreter, Git, Oracle database among many more.

It has a low level language that relates closely to the way machines work while still being easy to learn. (I wrote an article on how the computer machine works here https://medium.com/@petergambo/introduction-to-software-engineering-code-plateau-3-0-43bae990dc7e.)

Note: Understanding how computer memory works is  an important aspect of the C programming language.
